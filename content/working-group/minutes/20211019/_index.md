## Real Work

### Direction of openMobility for the Future

- Where should we proceed with openMobility?
- Options for the nature of openMobility:
  a) openMobility is a place to build and start a community around the topics mobility (no Budget, almost no infrastructure, no program plan, ...)
  b) openMobility should be a place to specifically work towards a common goal (with a program plan, a dedicated budget, ...)
  c) ...
- See OpenADx program plan at <https://openadx.eclipse.org/resources/2021-OpenADx-Program-Plan.pdf>
- Jakob: could be challenging to commit to common goals for the entire working group (diverse community in openMobility - industry and academia); budget could be challenging as well; situation would change, if we get a major industry partner from the traffic domain (like Swarco, ...) to become a member in openMobility
- Robert+Karl: initial expection of having paying industry partner members did not realize; interested in visibility and joint research with MOSAIC and SUMO
- A. Graf: moving the talks to Eclipse SUMO project would be ok for him
- There is no lack of topics to discuss among the members of openMobility - but maybe not enough for a majority of all group members?
- Options to proceed:
  - A) Build a program plan with minimal effort (based on OpenADx template)
  - B) Do not do a program plan, but try to establish openMobility as a vendor-neutral meeting point (working group "light")
  - C) Shutdown openMobility and meet as part of Eclipse SUMO or Automotive TLP
  - D) Potentially fusion with other Automotive Working Groups (e.g. OpenADx or new Working Groups)
- Next steps: Robert calls Michael Plagge to discuss these options
