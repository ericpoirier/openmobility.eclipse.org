## Real Work


### Direction of openMobility for the Future

- Where should we proceed with openMobility?
- Options for the nature of openMobility:
  a) openMobility is a place to build and start a community around the topics mobility (no Budget, almost no infrastructure, no program plan, ...)
  b) openMobility should be a place to specifically work towards a common goal (with a program plan, a dedicated budget, ...)
- Eclipse Foundation Working Group process requires a Working Group to have a program plan and a budget plan - which could be a form of orientation for the steering committee
- Michael P. suggests to align research initiatives in the field of mobility under the openMobility umbrella
- Jerome recommends to work in the field of advertising and marketing of open data success stories for public entities
- Christoph sees the burden and inflexibility of having a program plan
- Michele likes the free and informal exchange of ideas (in the area of SUMO)
- Robert is open towards having a program plan
- A budget plan with reasonable funds seems unlikely for everybody
