### Whitepaper: Survey or Landscape of Demand Generators for SUMO

- Current status - no new status update; foodle for the next meeting will be sent by Michael in the next days

### Direction of openMobility for the Future

- Where should we proceed with openMobility?
- Options for the nature of openMobility:
  a) openMobility is a place to build and start a community around the topics mobility (no Budget, almost no infrastructure, no program plan, ...)
  b) openMobility should be a place to specifically work towards a common goal (with a program plan, a dedicated budget, ...)
- Eclipse Foundation Working Group process requires a Working Group to have a program plan and a budget plan - which could be a form of orientation for the steering committee
- Michael P. suggests to align research initiatives in the field of mobility under the openMobility umbrella
- Jerome recommends to work in the field of advertising and marketing of open data success stories for public entities
- Christoph sees the burden and inflexibility of having a program plan
- Michele likes the free and informal exchange of ideas (in the area of SUMO)
- Robert is open towards having a program plan
- A budget plan with reasonable funds seems unlikely for everybody

## Any other Business

- EclipseCon Oct 25-28 (virtual event)
  - Community Day on Monday Oct 25
  - Joe Speed will talk a bit more about Indy Autonomous Challenge
  - Andy and I plan to have a session to introduce new users to the community, but also to connect with members of other working groups
  - BoF meeting on Tuesday afternoon

## Next Meetings

- Next meeting: Oct 19, 13:30-14:30 Berlin time
  - Please prepare your thoughts on the future of openMobility - do we want to define and follow a program plan?

- Technical meeting to follow next: Pedestrians and Shared Space
  - Foodle for a time slot in the next 4-6 weeks will be sent out by Michael Behrisch
